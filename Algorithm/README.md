# Algorithm
algorithm is not only the alogirthm in computer science department. It include this from applied math perspective but also involve numerical analysis, optimization, etc. The key idea is to bridge the local and global, as we mention modeling aims to study concrete phenomena from global/universal/general understanding to local(data point), while learning is from local to global, we have to have the "algorithm" to achieve this process. This is what we called "algorithm".
Definitely, the original definition of algorithm in computer science: Input, Output, Finiteness, Definiteness, Effectiveness are still useful and necessary. But here we basically consider more about how to take the algorithm as the bridge to help us explore the modeling and learning process which is actually the scientific research process.
