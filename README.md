# AppliedMathTraining
  Currently, the applied math community experienced a revolution to include both data-driven and first-principle-driven method with the algorithms as the bridge. The key driving force is the development of the machine learning, especially the neural-network based deep learning algorithms. This kind of development finally made the applied mathematics complete, it's the final piece of the puzzle of applied mathematics. The key methodology is to combine the data-driven method and first-principle method to deal with the curse of dimentionality appeared in the complex system, such as chemistry, materials science, biology, optimization, social science, etc. The common feature of these problems is the high dimentionality(more is different) and we have to select proper algorithm to deal with it. Here I would like to share related study during the learning with the recent resource during such kind of revolution in applied mathematics, scientific computing, computational science. This would also involve the whole picture study and provide the resources organized by myself for this kind of "Big Applied Mathematics Era".
  From this point of view, applied mathematics would become more like a methodology or even a series of prolem solving philosophy to connect abstract and concrete

### Whole Picture and System

Pure Mathematics


mapping


Applied Mathematics:Modeling/Algorithm/Learning


mapping


Physical Science---Information Science




The analog between physical science and information science is: More is different(Learning) + First Principle(Modeling)





Emerge: Biological Science, Social Science



### Recommend Textbook/Routine for the detailed study outside/under the big applied mathematics(holding):
