# AppliedMathTrainingwithCoding
  Currently, the applied math community experienced a revolution to include both data-driven and first-principle-driven method with the algorithm as the bridge. The key driving force is the development of the machine learning, especially the neural-network based deep learning algorithms. The key philosophy is to combine the data-driven method and first-principle method to deal with the curse of dimentionality appeared in the complex system, such as chemistry, materials science, biology, optimization, social science, etc. The common feature of these problems is the high dimentionality and we have to select proper algorithm to deal with it. Here I would like to share related personal coding during the learning with the recent resource during such kind of revolution in applied mathematics, scientific computing, computational science.
