# learning in applied math
Learning here means a kind of study starting from the data-driven. The key feature is to provide a local data-driven method and use it to provide global understanding.
Here learning actually refers to the mathematical way to capture pattern/structure/information from local(data point) to global(understanding). The large part of it is definitely machine learning, while it also could include any other data-driven method to help us understand more from data point.
