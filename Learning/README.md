# learning in applied math
Learning here means a kind of study starting from the data-driven to get the global descriptions. The key feature is to provide a local data-driven method and use it to provide global understanding.
Here learning actually refers to the mathematical way to capture pattern/structure/information from local(data point) to global(understanding). The large part of it is definitely machine learning, while it also could include any other data-driven method to help us understand more from data point.

Just like in model driven side, it can be divided into information perspective or physical perspective, but they can be both concluded into (high dimentional) learning scheme. This implies the learning side is more generalized comparing to model side, though in model driven side, we still have thermodynamics-information theory, statistical mechanics-probability graphical model like pairing indicating the similarity between information perspective and physical perspective.
