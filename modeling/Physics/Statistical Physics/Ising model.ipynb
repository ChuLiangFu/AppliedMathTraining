    "The original ising model is studied by Ising to understand the phase transition. Generally this kind of model can be written as:\n",
    "$$H(\\sigma) = \\sum_{ij} J_{ij} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j + \\sum_i \\mu_i\\sigma_i $$\n",
    "Here it assumes the lattice structure and $\\sigma$ is the spin on the lattice, $J$ and $\\mu$ is the related parameters. Generally, the first term represents the internal interaction inside the system, the second term represents the response of the external field. $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the whole system. This model is so simple but Actually very effective."
